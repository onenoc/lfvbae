1.  Why does lambda immediately get huge?
-why is the difference between y and f so big?
-lambda penalizes y and f close to each other
-if y and f are close, there is no reason lambda should be large
2.  rewrite so that the slicing of X into y and X_sim is not hardcoded like it is
3.  Add bias term for x, w in linear regression
4.  make it so that we learn the variance of the error term

affine invariant


Consider what happens as sample size goes to 0, sample size goes to medium, samples size gets large?
